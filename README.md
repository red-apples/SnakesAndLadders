# Snakes and Ladders 

The classic board game, with both a Graphical User Interface and a Command Line Interface. 

# Setup 

Board is setup through the "BoardSetup.txt". To add a snake or ladder, simply give the coordinate and a plus or minus 
sign. A plus represents a ladder, and a minus a snake.
